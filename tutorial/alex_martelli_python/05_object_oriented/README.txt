# pag. 81, Object-Oriented Python
#          Python is an object-oriented programming language. Unlinke some
#          other object-oriented languages, Python doens't force you to use
#          the object-oriented paradigm exclusively. Python also supports
#          procedural programming with modules and functions, so you can
#          select the most suitable programming paradigm for each part of
#          your program. Generally, the object-oriented paradigm is suitable
#          when you want to group state (data) and behavior (code) together
#          in handy packets of functionality. It's also useful when you want
#          to use some of Python's object oriented mechanism covered in this
#          chapter, such as inheritance or special methods.
#          The procedural paradigm, based on modules and functions, may be
#          simpler, and thus more suitable when you don't need any of the
#          benefits of object-oriented programming. With Python, you can mix
#          and match the two paradigms.
#          Python today is in transition between two slightly different object
#          models. This chapter mainly describes the new-style, or new object
#          model, which is simpler, more regular, more powerful, and the one
#          I recommend you always use; whenever I speak of classes or instances
#          without explicitly specifying otherwise, I mean new-style classes
#          or instances.
