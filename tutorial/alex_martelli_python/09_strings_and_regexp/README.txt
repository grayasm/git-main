# pag. 186, Chapter 9. Strings and Regular Expressions
#
#           Python supports plain and Unicode strings extensively, with
#           statements, operators, built-in functions, methods, and dedicated
#           modules.
#           Regular expressions let you specify pattern strings and allow
#           searches and substitutions. Regular expressions are not easy to
#           master, but they can be a powerful tool for processing text.
#           Python offers rich regular expression functionality through the
#           built-in re module.
