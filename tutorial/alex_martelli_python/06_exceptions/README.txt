# pag. 121, Exceptions
#           Python uses exceptions to communicate errors and anomalies.
#           An exception is an object that indicates an error or anomalous
#           condition. When Python detects an error, it raises an exception
#           - that is, Python signals the occurance of an anomalous condition
#           by passing an exception object to the exception-propagation
#           mechanism. Your code can explicitly raise an exception by executing
#           a raise statement.
#           Handling an exception means receiving the exception object from the
#           propagation mechanism and performing whatever actions are needed to
#           deal with the anomalous situation. If a program does not handle an
#           exception, the program terminates with an error traceback message.
#           However, a program can handle exceptions and keep running despite
#           errors or other abnormal conditions.
