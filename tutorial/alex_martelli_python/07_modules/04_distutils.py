# pag. 150, The Distribution Utilities (distutils)
#           When you distribute a package as a self-installing executable or
#           platform-specific installer, a user can then install the package
#           simply by running the installer. How to run such an installer
#           program depends on the platform, but it no longer matters which
#           language the program was written in. How to build self-contained,
#           ready-to run executables for various platforms is covered
#           in Chapter 27.
