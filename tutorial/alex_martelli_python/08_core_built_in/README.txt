# pag. 153, Chapter 8. Core Built-ins
#
#           The term built-in has more than one meaning in Python. In most
#           contexts, a built-in means an object directly accessible to Python
#           code without an import statement.
#           Built-in types in Python include numbers, sequences, dictionaries,
#           sets, functions (Chapter 4), classes (Chapter 5),
#           standard exception classes (Chapter 6), and modules (Chapter 7)
#           The built-in file object is covered in (Chapter 10), and
#           some built-in types intrinsic to Python’s internal operation
#           (Chapter 13)
#           Some modules are known as “built-in” because they are an integral
#           part of the Python standard library (even though it takes an import
#           statement to access them), as distinguished from separate, optional
#           add-on modules, also called Python extensions.
