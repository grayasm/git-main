# pag. 175, The functional Module
#           The functional module (introduced in Python 2.5) is intended to
#           eventually supply several interesting functions and types to
#           support functional programming in Python. At the time of writing,
#           there is debate about renaming the module to functools , or perhaps
#           introducing a separate functools module, to hold higher-order
#           functions not strictly connected to the idioms of functional
#           programming (in particular, built-in decorators).


import functools

# functools.partial(func, *a, **k)
