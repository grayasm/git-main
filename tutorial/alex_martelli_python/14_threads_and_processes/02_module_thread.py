'''
The thread Module.
The only part of the thread module that your code should use directly is the
lock objects that module thread supplies. Locks are simple thread-
synchronization primitives. Technically, thread â€™s locks are non-reentrant and
unowned: they do not keep track of which thread last locked them, so there is
no specific owner thread for a lock. A lock is in one of two states, locked or
unlocked.
