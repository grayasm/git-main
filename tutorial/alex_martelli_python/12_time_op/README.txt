    cap.12 Time Operations, pag. 302

    A Python program can handle time in several ways.

    Time intervals are floating-point numbers in units of seconds (a fraction
    of a second is the fractional part of the interval).

    Particular instants in time are expressed in seconds since a reference
    instant, known as the epoch. (Midnight, UTC, of January 1, 1970, is a
    popular epoch used on both Unix and Windows platforms.) Time instants often
    also need to be expressed as a mixture of units of measurement (e.g., years,
    months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds), particularly for I/O purposes.

    I/O, of course, also requires the ability to format times and dates into
    human-readable strings, and parse them back from string formats.
