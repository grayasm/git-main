# pag. 264, The msvcrt Module
#           The msvcrt module, available only on Windows, supplies functions
#           that let Python programs access a few proprietary extras supplied
#           by the Microsoft Visual C++â€™s runtime library msvcrt.dll.
#           Some msvcrt functions let you read user input character by
#           character rather than reading a full line at a time.
