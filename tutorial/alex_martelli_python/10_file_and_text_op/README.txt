# pag. 215, Chapter 10. File and Text Operations
#
#           This chapter covers most of the issues related to dealing with
#           files and the file-system in Python. A file is a stream of bytes
#           that a program can read and/or write; a filesystem is a hierarchical
#           repository of files on a computer system.
