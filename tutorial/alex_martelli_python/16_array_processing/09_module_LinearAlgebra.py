LinearAlgebra supplies Python-callable functions, operating on data held in
Numeric arrays, wrapping either the LAPACK Fortran-coded library or the
compatible C-coded lapack_lite library. LinearAlgebra lets you invert
matrices, solve linear systems, compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors,
perform singular value decomposition, and least-squares-solve overdeter-
mined linear systems.
