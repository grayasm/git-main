/* Cap.6 Objects
   6.1.3 Prototypes

   $ node 03_object_prototype.js

   Every JavaScript object has a second JavaScript object associated with it,
       known as prototype. The first object inherits properties from the prototype.

   new Object() inherits from Object.prototype
   new Array() inherits from Array.prototype
   new Date() inherits from Date.prototype

   Examples are in 6.2.2, 6.8.1 and 9.
