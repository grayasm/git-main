/* Cap.6 Objects
   6.10.4  The valueOf() Method

   $ node 22_method_valueOf.js


   The valueOf() method is much like the toString() method, but it is called
   when JavaScript needs to convert an object to some primitive type other than
   a stringâ€”typically, a number.

   Reference:
   Object.valueOf()
   Date.valueOf()
