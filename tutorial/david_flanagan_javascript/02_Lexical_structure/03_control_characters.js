/* Cap.2 Lexical Structure
   2.1.2 Whitespace, Line Breaks and Format Control Characters
*/


/* Unlike Python, in JavaScript you can use spaces and newlines freely in your
   programs. You can format and ident your programs in a neat and consisten way
   that makes the code easy to read and understand.

   JavaScript recognizes the following characters as whitespace:
   \u0020 - regular space character
   \u0009 - tab
   \u000B - vertical tab
   \u000C - form feed
   \u00A0 - nonbreaking space
   \uFEFF - byte order mark

   JavaScript recognizes the following characters as line terminators:
   \u000A - line feed
   \u000D - carriage return
   \u2028 - line separator
   \u2029 - paragraph separator

   Unicode format control characters are used in visual presentation of text:
   \u200F - RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK
   \u200E - LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK

   Special case allowed in an identifier, but not as first character:
   \u200D - ZERO WIDTH JOINER
   \u200C - ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
