    Inspired by Firebug extension for Firefox (http://getfirebug.com/) today's
    web browsers all include web developer tools for debugging, experimenting
    and learning. You can find these tools in the Tools menu of the browser
    under names like "Developer Tools" or "Web Console".
    Often, you can call up a console with a keystroke like F12 or Ctrl-Shift-J

    There is a simple console API that is portably implemented by modern
    browsers. You can use the function console.log() to display text on the
    console. A similar but more intrusive way to display output or debugging
    messages is by passing a string of text to the alert() fuction, which
    displays it in a modal dialog box.
