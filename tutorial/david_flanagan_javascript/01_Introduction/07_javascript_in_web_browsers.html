    JavaScript in Web Browsers, cap.13

    The most important thing you'll learn in that chapter is that JavaScript
    code can be embedded within HTML files using the <script> tag.
-->

<html>
  <head>
    <script src="library.js"></script> <!-- include a library of JavaScript code -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is a paragraph of HTML</p>
    <script>
      // And this is some client-side JavaScript code
      // literally embedded within the HTML file
    </script>
    <p>Here is more HTML.</p>
  </body>
</html>
