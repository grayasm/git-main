/* Cap.4 Expressions and Operators
   4.13.4 The void Operator

   $ node 27_the_void_operator.js


   The most common use for this operator is in a client-side javascript: URL,
   where it allows you to evaluate an expression for its side effects without
   the browser displaying the value of the evaluated expression.

   For example, you might use the void operator in an HTML <a> tag as follows:
   <a href="javascript:void window.open();">Open New Window</a>
