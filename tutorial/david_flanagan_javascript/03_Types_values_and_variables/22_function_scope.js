/* Cap.3 Types, Values and Variables
   3.10.1  Function Scope and Hoisting

   $ node 22_function_scope.js

   The block scope as we know it from C behaves differently in JavaScript.
     -  a local variable to a function body is visible also above the place
        of declaration (hosting)
     -  a local variable to a nested function body is visible
