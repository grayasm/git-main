   Signature  : see README.txt for complete signature
   Description:
        - shared_ptr is a smart pointer that retains shared ownership of an
          object through a pointer. Several shared_ptr objects may own the same
          object. The object is detroyed and its memory deallocated when either
          of the following happens:
             * the last remaining shared_ptr owning the object is detroyed
             * the last remaining shared_ptr owning the object is assigned
               another pointer via operator= or reset()
        - the object is detroyed using delete-expression or a custom deleter
          that is supplied to shared_ptr during construction
        - shared_ptr can be accessed safely from multiple thread only by using
          std::atomic...<std::shared_ptr> functions, defined in header <atomic>
