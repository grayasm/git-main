/*      A different approach to redirecting inserts into the appropriate
        partition table is to set up rules, instead of a trigger, on the
        master table.

        A rule has significantly more overhead than a trigger,
        but the overhead is paid once per query rather than once per row,
        so this method might be advantageous for bulk-insert situations.
        In most cases, however, the trigger method will offer better performance.

        Another disadvantage of the rule approach is that there is no simple way
        to force an error if the set of rules doesnâ€™t cover the insertion date;
        the data will silently go into the master table instead.
