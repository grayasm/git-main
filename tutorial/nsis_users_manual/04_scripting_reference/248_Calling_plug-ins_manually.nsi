; 4.11.2 Calling plug-ins manually
; If you want to call a plug-in that is stored on user's hard drive or somewhere else, use CallInstDLL. 
; Almost all plug-ins provide installer functionality, so using plug-in commands is way easier. 
; Using CallInstDLL can be useful when you have created plug-ins that are linked to a certain version 
; of your application and are being copied to the installation folder.
