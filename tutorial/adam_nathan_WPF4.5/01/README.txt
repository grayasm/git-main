==Hardware acceleration==
	WPF is built on Direct3D, so content in a WPF application, whether 2D or 3D,
	graphics or text is converted to 3D triangles, textures and other Direct3D
	objects and then rendered by hardware.
	
	WPF though doesn't require high-end graphics hardware as it has a software
	rendering pipeline as well.
	
==Declarative programming==
	WPF takes declarative programming to the next level with
	Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML; pronounced "Zammel")
	WPF uses XAML as a document format, a representation of 3D moddles, and more.
