/*
  QMultiMap

  This section discusses the QMultiMap class, but all that I say also applies
  to the QMultiHash class. The QMultiMap class does not have a [] operator;
  instead, the insert method is used for adding values and the method values
  for accessing the inserted items. Because the QMultiMap can contain multiple
  elements for a key, the values method returns a QList with the items
  associated with the given key. Before requesting a list, it is possible to
  see how many items are associated to a given key using the count method.
