    What Are Generics?

    At its core, the term generics means parameterized types. Parameterized
    types are important because they enable you to create classes, structures,
    interfaces, methods, and delegates in which the type of data upon which
    they operate is specified as a parameter.

    Using generics, it is possible to create a single class, for example,
    that automatically works with different types of data. A class, structure,
    interface, method, or delegate that operates on a parameterized type is
    called generic, as in generic class or generic method.

    NOTE:
        A Warning to C++ and Java Programmers: Although C# generics are similar
        to templates in C++ and generics in Java, they are not the same as
        either. In fact, there are some fundamental differences among these
        three approaches to generics. If you have a background in C++ or Java,
        it is important to not jump to conclusions about how generics work in
        C#. :)
