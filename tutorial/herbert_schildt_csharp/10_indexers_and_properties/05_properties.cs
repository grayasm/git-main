/*
    Properties
    Another type of class member is the property. As a general rule, a property
    combines a field with the methods that access it. As some examples earlier
    in this book have shown, you will often want to create a field that is
    available to users of an object, but you want to maintain control over the
    operations allowed on that field. For instance, you might want to limit the
    range of values that can be assigned to that field. While it is possible to
    accomplish this goal through the use of a private variable along with
    methods to access its value, a property offers a better, more streamlined
    approach.

    Properties are similar to indexers. A property consists of a name along
    with get and set accessors. The accessors are used to get and set the value
    of a variable. The key benefit of a property is that its name can be used in
    expressions and assignments like a normal variable, but in actuality the
    get and set accessors are automatically invoked. This is similar to the
    way that an indexerâ€™s get and set accessors are automatically used.

    The general form of a property is shown here:
    type name
    {
        get
        {
            // get accessor code
        }

        set
        {
            // set accessor code
        }
    }

    Here, type specifies the type of the property, such as int, and name is the
    name of the property. Once the property has been defined, any use of name
    results in a call to its appropriate accessor.

    The set accessor automatically receives a parameter called value that
    contains the  value being assigned to the property. It is important to
    understand that properties do not define storage locations. Instead, a
    property typically manages access to a field. It does not, itself, provide
    that field. The field must be specified independently of the property.
    The exception is the auto-implemented property, which is described shortly.

// A simple property example.

using System;


class SimpProp
{
    int prop; // field being managed by MyProp

    public SimpProp() { prop = 0; }

    /* This is the property that supports access to
       the private instance variable prop. It
       allows only positive values. */

    public int MyProp
    {
        get
        {
            return prop;
        }

        set
        {
            if(value >= 0) prop = value;
        }
    }
}


// Demonstrate a property.
class PropertyDemo
{
    static void Main()
    {
        SimpProp ob = new SimpProp();
        Console.WriteLine("Original value of ob.MyProp: " + ob.MyProp);
        ob.MyProp = 100; // assign value
        Console.WriteLine("Value of ob.MyProp: " + ob.MyProp);

        // Can't assign negative value to prop.
        Console.WriteLine("Attempting to assign -10 to ob.MyProp");
        ob.MyProp = -10;
        Console.WriteLine("Value of ob.MyProp: " + ob.MyProp);
    }
}
