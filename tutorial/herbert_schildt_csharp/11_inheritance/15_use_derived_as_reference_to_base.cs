/*
    Although the preceding discussion may seem a bit esoteric, it has some
    important practical applications. One is described here. The other is
    discussed later in this chapter, when virtual methods are covered.

    An important place where derived class references are assigned to base class
    variables is when constructors are called in a class hierarchy. As you know,
    it is common for a class to define a constructor that takes an object of its
    class as a parameter. This allows the class to construct a copy of an
    object. Classes derived from such a class can take advantage of this
    feature.
