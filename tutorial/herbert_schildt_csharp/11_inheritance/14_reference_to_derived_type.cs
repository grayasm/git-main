/*
    In general, an object reference variable can refer only to objects of its type.
There is, however, an important exception to C#â€™s strict type enforcement. A reference
variable of a base class can be assigned a reference to an object of any class derived from
that base class. This is legal because an instance of a derived type encapsulates an instance
of the base type. Thus, a base class reference can refer to it.
