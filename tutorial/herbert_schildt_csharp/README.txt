    The Complete Reference C# 4.0
        by Herbert Schildt
        (C) 2010

        * Covers the entire C# language
        * Details new 4.0 features, such as the Task Parallel library,
          PLINQ, the dynamic type and more
        * Hundreds of easy-to-follow-examples


Notes:
    - iptables or ip6tables currently blocks C# ui (winforms or gtk-sharp)
      I disabled iptables for now.
