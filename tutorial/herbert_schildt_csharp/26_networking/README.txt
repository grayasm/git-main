    Networking Through the Internet Using System.Net

    Networking support is contained in several namespaces defined by
    the .NET Framework. The primary namespace for networking is System.Net.
    It defines a large number of highlevel, easy-to-use classes that
    support the various types of operations common to the Internet.
    Several namespaces nested under System.Net are also provided.
    For example, low-level networking control through sockets is found
    in System.Net.Sockets. Mail support is found in System.Net.Mail.
    Support for secure network streams is found in System.Net.Security.
    Several other nested namespaces provide additional functionality.
    Another important networking-related namespace is System.Web.
    It (and its nested namespaces) supports ASP.NET-based network applications.
    Although the .NET Framework offers great flexibility and many options
    for networking, for many applications, the functionality provided by
    System.Net is a best choice. It provides both convenience and ease-of-use.
    For this reason, System.Net is the namespace we will be using in this
    chapter.
