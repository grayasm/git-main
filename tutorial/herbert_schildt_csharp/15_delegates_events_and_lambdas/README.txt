    Chapter 15. Delegates, Events and Lambda Expressions

    This chapter examines three innovative C# features:
    delegates, events, and lambda expressions.

    A delegate provides a way to encapsulate a method.

    An event is a notification that some action has occurred. Delegates and
    events are related because an event is built upon a delegate. Both expand
    the set of programming tasks to which C# can be applied.

    The lambda expression is a relatively new syntactic feature that offers a
    streamlined, yet powerful way to define what is, essentially, a unit of
    executable code. Lambda expressions are often used when working with
    delegates and events because a delegate can refer to a lambda expression.
    (Lambda expressions are also very important to LINQ, which is described in
    Chapter 19.) Also examined are anonymous methods, covariance,
    contravariance, and method group conversions.
