/*
    Passing an Argument to a Thread.
    It is possible to pass an argument to a thread. To do so, you must
    use different forms of Start( ), the Thread constructor, and the
    entry point method. An argument is passed to a thread through this
    version of Start( ):

public void Start(object parameter)

    The object passed to parameter is automatically passed to the
    threadâ€™s entry point method. Thus, to pass an argument to a thread,
    you pass it to Start( ). To make use of the parameterized version
    of Start( ), you must use the following form of the Thread constructor:

public Thread(ParameterizedThreadStart start)
