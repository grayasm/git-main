/*
    When a child thread is started, it receives a default priority setting.
    You can change a threadâ€™s priority through the Priority property,
    which is a member of Thread. This is its general form:

public ThreadPriority Priority{ get; set; }

    ThreadPriority is an enumeration that defines the following five
    priority settings:

ThreadPriority.Highest
ThreadPriority.AboveNormal
ThreadPriority.Normal
ThreadPriority.BelowNormal
ThreadPriority.Lowest

    The default priority setting for a thread is ThreadPriority.Normal.
