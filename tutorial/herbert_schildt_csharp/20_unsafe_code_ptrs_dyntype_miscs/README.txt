    Declaring a Pointer
    Pointer variables must be declared as such. The general form of a
    pointer variable declaration is:

type* var-name;

    The * and & Pointer Operators
    Two operators are used with pointers: * and &. The & is a unary operator
    that returns the memory address of its operand.
