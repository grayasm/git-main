/*
    Create a Dynamic Type with dynamic.
    With an important exception, the dynamic type is similar to object
    because it can be used to refer to any type of object. The difference
    between object and dynamic is that all type checking related to a
    dynamic type is deferred until runtime. (With object, type checking
    still occurs at compile time.) The benefit of waiting until runtime
    is that, at compile time, a dynamic object is assumed to support any
    operation, including the use of operators, calls to methods, access
    to fields, and so on. This enables code to be compiled without error.
    Of course, if at runtime the objectâ€™s actual type does not support
    the operation, then a runtime exception will occur.
