/*
    A Second Exception Example
    It is important to understand that all code executed within a try block
    is monitored for exceptions. This includes exceptions that might be
    generated by a method called from within the try block. An exception
    thrown by a method called from within a try block can be caught by that
    try block, assuming, of course, that the method itself did not catch
    the exception.
