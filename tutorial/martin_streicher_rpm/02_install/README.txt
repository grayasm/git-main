    This is the Part2.pdf : Upgrading and uninstalling software.
                            by Martin Streicher

    part2 is a startup package to learn how rpmbuild works.
    The .sh script will prepare the tar.gz for building.
    The .spec file will install the package in /tmp/part2.

    No other hooks will be used as %pre, %post, %preun, %postun.
    Also no trigger will be used.
