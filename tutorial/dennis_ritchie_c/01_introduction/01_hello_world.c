/* Cap. 1 - A Tutorial Introduction

   Normally you are at liberty to give functions whatever names you like,
   but "main" is special - your program begins executing at the beginning
   of main.

   All forms are valid:
        main()
   void main()
   void main(int argc, char**)
   int  main()
   int  main(int argc, char**)
 */

main()
{
    printf("hello, world!\n");
}
