  1. C style comment:  /*   */
  2. basic data types: char,short,int,long,float,double
  3. integer division truncates: any fractional part is discarded
  4. an operator with one integer and one floating-point operand will promote
     the integer to floating-point before the operation is done
  5. in printf %% will escape the % itself
  6. in stdio.h EOF is -1
  7. the semicolon at the end of if(ret); is called a null statement
  8. use parameter for a variable named in the parenthesized list in a function
     definition, and argument for the value used in a call of the function
  9. formal argument and actual argument are sometimes used for the same
     distinction
 10. in C all function arguments are passed "by value"
 11. declaration is where the variable is stated but no storage is allocated
 12. definition is where the variable is created and storage is assigned
 13. extern keyword should appear at the beginning of a function where a
     variable is used but its definition is in another file
