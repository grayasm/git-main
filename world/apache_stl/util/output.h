   Umbrella (dispatch) function to analyse the (saved) output of target.

   This file opens the saved output for parsing.  If this fails, 
   the status structure is updated to reflect this.  Otherwise, check_test (),
   check_compat_test (), or check_example () is called to parse the output
   file.

   @param target the path to the executable that generated the output file 
   being parsed.
   @param status status object to record results in.
