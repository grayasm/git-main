   Translates a human understandable signal name into a number usable by kill ().

   This method understands several formats for signal names.  They are as follows:
   - n
   - SIGFOO
   - FOO
   In this list, n denotes a number and FOO denotes a short signal name.

   @param signame a signal name to decode
   @returns the signal number or -1 if a number couldn't be determined
   @see signal_names []

   Translates a signal number into a human understandable name

   @param signo a signal number
   @returns the human understandable name for the signal (minus the SIG 
   prefix), or "#n" if the the name for the number is unknown to the 
   function, where n is signo

/**
   Entry point to the child process (watchdog) subsystem.

   On UNIX systems, this method fork ()s, creating a child process.  This 
   child process becomes a process group leader, redirects input and output 
   files, then exec ()s the target specified in argv [0], providing it with 
   argv to use as its argv array.  Meanwhile, the parent process calls the 
   wait_for_child method to monitor the child process, passing the return 
   value back to the calling method.

   On Windows, this method creates a process using the windows CreateProcess 
   API call. The startup context for this process is based on the context of 
   the exec utility, but with the standard * file handles redirected.  The 
   execution of the process is monitored with the WaitForSingleObject API 
   call.  If the process doesn't complete within the allowed timeout, it is 
   then killed.  On Windows NT systems, a soft kill of the process (via the 
   GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent API call) are first attempted attempted.  The 
   process is then hard killed via the TerminateProcess API call.

   @param exec_name name of the child executable
   @param argv argv array for child process
   @return structure describing how the child procees exited
   @see wait_for_child ()
