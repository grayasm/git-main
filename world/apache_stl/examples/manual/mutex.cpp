 * mutex.cpp - Example program for mutex.
 *
 * This program illustraes how to mutexes are used to synchronize access
 * to resources in a multi-threaded program.
 * 
 * NOTE: this program exposes implementation details of the Rogue Wave(R)
 *       C++ Standard library which are subject to change without notice
 *       from one version of the library to another. Portable code should
 *       avoid relying on any implementation details.
