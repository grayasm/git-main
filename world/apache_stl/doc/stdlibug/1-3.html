<H2>1.3 Usage Notes</H2>
<A NAME="131"><H3>1.3.1 Compatibility Issues</H3></A>
<P>This implementation of the C++ Standard Library conforms to <I>ISO/IEC 14882:2003 --  International Standard for Information Systems  --  Programming Language C++</I>.  This release is source compatible with previous 2.x implementations.</P>
<P>1.x implementations of the library were based on <I>ANSI's Working Paper for Draft Proposed International Standard for Information Systems  --  Programming Language C++</I>.  The draft standard differs from the final standard in some areas.  As a result, source written to 1.x implementations of the library will be incompatible with this implementation in these areas.  See the readme file for details.</P>
<P>Please note that some compiler and library vendors have not yet implemented the whole range of language features defined by the ANSI/ISO standard. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><HR><B>
NOTE -- The C++ Standard Library is not yet fully implemented by all compilers. You may experience difficulty if you attempt to use features of the library that are unsupported by your compiler.
</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In the <I>User's Guide</I>, we draw your attention to places in the code where this might be a problem. If your vendor is still in the process of meeting the standard, some of the techniques demonstrated in this <I>User's Guide</I> may not work. We include them anyway to demonstrate the full range of capabilities of the standard C++ language. Compilers will catch up, and this guide will be more useful to you if it is as complete as possible.</P>
<A NAME="132"><H3>1.3.2 The std Namespace</H3></A>
<P>Everything in the Apache C++ Standard Library is contained in the <SAMP>std</SAMP> namespace. You must specify a <SAMP>using</SAMP> directive or explicitly scope any name from the library.</P>
<P>To use the <B><I><A HREF="../stdlibref/vector.html">vector</A></I></B> class, for example, you could include one of the following <SAMP>using</SAMP> directives:</P>

<UL><PRE>
using namespace std;       // Brings all names from std
                           // into current scope. 

using std::vector;         // Brings vector into
                           // current scope.
</PRE></UL>
<P>or explicitly scope <B><I><A HREF="../stdlibref/vector.html">vector</A></I></B> whenever it is used: </P>

<UL><PRE>
std::vector&lt;int&gt; v; 
</PRE></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE><HR><B>
NOTE -- To enhance this manual's readability,  namespace scoping is usually omitted in the text. You should assume that everything in the Apache C++ Standard Library is scoped in namespace <SAMP>std</SAMP> unless otherwise stated.
</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE>
