/* IEEE 754 (IEC 559 supeseded by IEC 60559) specifies that
 * the following operations return NaN unless they trap:
 *
 *     1.   sqrt (n); n < 0
 *     2.   rem (x, 0.0), rem (inf, x)
 *     3.   0 * inf
 *     4.   0.0 / 0.0, inf / inf
 *     5.   inf - inf (when both inf have the same sign)
 *
 * Traps are defined as kind of an exception, typically
 * causing the delivery of SIGFPE (e.g., with Compaq C++
 * on Tru64 UNIX, except when using the -ieee flag which
 * disables traps as required by C).
