/**
 * Initializes the test driver, passes program arguments to it, processes
 * command line arguments, any arguments specified in the environment
 * variable RWSTD_TESTOPTS, and if successful, invokes the program-supplied
 * callback function.
 *
 * @param argc  The number of non-null elements in the argv array.
 * @param argv  A null-terminated array of command line arguments.
 *        If (argc == 0) the argument may be null.
 * @param filename  The name of the source file name, typically
 *        the __FILE__ macro. The argument may be null.
 * @param clause  The clause exercised by the program, such as
 *        lib.basic.string. The argument may be null.
 * @param comment An optional comment describing in more detail
 *        the functionality of the program. The argument may be null.
 * @param testfun  A pointer to a callback function to call by the
 *        driver after successful initialization. The argument must
 *        not be null.
 * @param optspec An optional character string describing command
 *        line options accepted by the program. The argument may
 *        be null.
 * @param ...  Optional list of handlers of command line options
 *         corresponding to the optspec.
 *
 * @return If initialization is successful, returns the value returned
 *         by the callback function. Otherwise, returns the non-zero
 *         value returned by the last initialization function or
 *         command line option handler.
 *
 * After the driver has been initialzied the user-supplied callback function
 * may call any of the driver diagnostic functions to record and perhaps also
 * issue diagnostic messages of varying severity.
 *
 * There are 10 levels of severity with 0 being the lowest and 9 the highest.
 * Diagnostics of all levels of severity come in two states: active and
 * inactive. All diagnostics are recorded but normally only active diagnostics
 * of severity 4 or above are issued. It is possible to cause diagnostics of
 * lower severity levels to be issued via a command line option to the driver.
 * Choosing to issue severity 0 diagnostics has the effect of issuing inactive
 * diagnostics.
 *
 * After the callback function returns the driver displays a summary detailing
 * the number of recorded diagnostics in each of the two states (active and
 * inactive).

 * Records and optionally issues a diagnostic of the highest severity 9.

 * @param filename  An optional name of the file invoking the function.
 *        The argument may be null.
 * @param line  When positive, denotes the line number of the location
 *        relevant to the diagnostic. Negative values are ignored.
 * @param fmtspec  A printf format specifier (with extensions) used
 *        to format the text of the diagnostic.  See rwtest-fmtspec page
 *        for details.
 * @param ... Optional list of values to format.

 *
 * Every diagnostic is recorded but only active diagnostics may be issued,
 * depending on the setting of the diagnosable severity. The value of the
 * first argument determines whether a diagnostc is active or inactive.
 * Unlike the remaining diagnostic functions, rw_fatal doesn't return to
 * the caller when expr is 0 (i.e., when the diagnostic is active).
 * Instead, it causes the driver the exit the process with the staus equal
 * to 9, the severity of the diagnostic.
