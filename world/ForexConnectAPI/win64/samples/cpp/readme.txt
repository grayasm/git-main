Notes for ForexConnect API C++ samples:

1. ForexConnect API C++ samples (the NonTableManagerSamples and TableManagerSamples folders)
use the sample_tools library as source code and as a pre-compiled binary file.
The library is located in ForexConnectAPI\samples\cpp\sample_tools\
For correct work of the samples, it is necessary to re-compile the library
before compiling the samples.
Both the library and samples must be compiled by using the same version of Visual Studio.

2. To build all the ForexConnect API C++ samples, MS Visual Studio 2015 is required.
If you need ForexConnect API C++ samples for MS Visual Studio 2005, download them
